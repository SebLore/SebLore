# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ 

## Seems you stumbled upon my coding corner!  

I'm **Sebastian**, a computer science student/C++ developer who likes to dabble in just about everything technology related. Whenever I get an idea in my head and I feel like it's something that I might, at some point, do more than once in my life, I will devise a program that will make it 10% more efficient than doing it manually and dive into it head first. Some times (often times) I get a bit lost in the sauce and have to start over.

## ðŸ’» What my deal is

I am a full-time student, so most of my programming time goes into school-related projects that I am not allowed to share as public repos. Beyond that,  
`C++` is my main jam, but I tinker with:
- `Python`, when I just want to make a thing
- `DirectX`, because graphics are cool  
- `JavaScript/HTML/CSS` (that website's not gonna build itself)  
- `Obsidian`, my gateway into css and markdown

## ðŸ§  This is your brain on Ritalin  

If you have a look around this repo, you can probably tell that I have **way too many projects** â€”some half-baked, some just started, and a few that I have managed to get to a functioning state. I have ADHD and one of my main struggles is that I get new ideas faster than I can finish old ones. I fully intend to finish the vast majority of them **at some point**

## ðŸ”§ Currently tinkering with

- **Building my own website:** The (WIP) version of which you can see [here](Seblore.github.io)
- **Transferring to Linux:** Because Microsoft is in a race with nobody to see who can make their OS as bloated as possible
- **Writing a markdown-to-LaTeX parser:** When school assignments demand the use of LaTeX but you're a certified doctor (laugh), it's time to get creative...

## ðŸ“« Let's Connect!  

Feel free to open an issue, fork something, or just drop by to say hi! I'm always ready to learn new things and try weird shit!
